## What is an Update Set?
Update sets take all the changes you did and puts them together. It records all of the work you have done on a scrum task or story. Your work won't be moved to Test if it's not in an Update Set!

### Never change a complete update set to 'in progress'. Instead, create a completely new update set and add 2 to the original title or 3 if you have already made a second, etc.

### If you do not want this work to be moved forward, change state to ignore. Update sets cannot be deleted.
