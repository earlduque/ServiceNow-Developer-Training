# Service Portal Standards

Aka Widgets, Pages, and the front-end.

### Portals

- Follow campus design standards (eg. common footer, color schemes, font-families, etc.)

### Widgets

- Do not display restricted information unless the user is logged in and is supposed to be able to see such information.
- Design widgets to be re-usable
- Do not edit other application widgets without permission
- Copy out-of-box widgets and edit the copy instead of editing the original.
- Be aware of how many libraries you import as it can impact performance.
