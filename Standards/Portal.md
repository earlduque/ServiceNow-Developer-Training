# Service Portal Standards

Aka Widgets, Pages, and the front-end.

### Portals
- New portals should be vetted by the TAG or IET Service Management as they may be granting access or read access to items/records that are not intended for the public
- Follow campus design standards (eg. common footer, color schemes, font-families, etc.)

### Widgets

- Do not display restricted information unless the user is logged in and is supposed to be able to see such information.
- Design widgets to be re-usable
- Do not edit other application widgets without permission
- Copy out-of-box widgets and edit the copy instead of editing the original.

### Pages

- If using role restrictions, evoke CAS for users not logged in first.
