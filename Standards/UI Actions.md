# UI Actions Standards

+ Use a distinctive name to distinguish from other UI Actions
+ Use buttons, menus, and links appropriately in forms and lists. For example, do not clutter a form with too many buttons.
+ Avoid putting all necessary logic in the UI Action, it is preferred to leverage Business Rules or Script Includes instead
+ Do not modify commonly used UI Actions such as Save or Delete
+ Add role restrictions to buttons you do not want accidentally pressed
