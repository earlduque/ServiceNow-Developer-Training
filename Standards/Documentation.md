# Documentation Standards

+ For scripts
    + Comment code as if the original author will not be around anymore
    + Comment on functions with full parameter and return descriptions
+ For others
    + Determine if a KB article is necessary
    + Otherwise provide a good description in the description field
+ Keep comments/documentation as accurate and updated as possible
+ Ensure documentation is well-written, clear, and meaningful
+ Do not be verbose and unnecessary with your comments. For example, commenting about initializing a `GlideRecord` or variable.
